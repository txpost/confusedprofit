#confusedprofit

Confused Profit is a bot and self-proclaimed prophet. It experiments with the foolproof "buy low, sell high" and applies an array of adjectives that may or may not result in profits. At their best, the results can be both amusing and honest.

Confused Profit uses the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/) to generate a list of random adjectives every couple of hours, then checks those adjectives until it finds one that has an antonym. The tweet compiles as "Buy `adjective`. Sell `antonym`. Profit."
